Тема: Problem of finding point seeing all segments completely

Dear, Professor Mark de Berg.

My name is Kirill and I am a 5th year Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University student of applied math.
In one of computatinal geometry columns (Column 37, presented on 15 1999) I found following task presented by You:

	Solve the following problem in o(n^4) time:
	Let S be a set of n segments in the plane. Determine whether there is a point p seeing all segments
	completely.

Now I am working at this task as student project and I want to ask You, maybe over the past years this problem got some progress
(maybe it is solved for some special cases or it is prooved that it is impossible to solve it in o(n^4), maybe something else)
or maybe this problem is solved completly.

Thank You for Your time. I will be glad to hear any kind of answer from You.

Yours sincerely,
Kuksenko Kirill.
